<h3>~ Preamble ~</h3>

<br>
<p>I took an interest in cooking in my mid-twenties, when I began living on my own as an adult. At this time, I also decided to become vegetarian to encourage myself to eat healthier.</p>
<br>
<p>Given my background (Indian ethnicity, raised in the Middle East, living in the USA), I have been lucky to be exposed to several types of cuisines from a young age. My comfort foods are Indian
and Middle Eastern, because it takes me back to my childhood days. Living in cosmopolitan cities has also allowed me to discover and grow fond of American (traditional and modern), Mediterrenean, Mexican 
and Asian food.</p>
<br>
<p>I like to learn about and experiment with various spices, herbs and ingredients authentic to my favorite cuisines. I also enjoy trying to mix and match different flavors, and making vegetarian versions
of non-vegetarian dishes. Finally, I also like to ensure the food I make is healthy, nutritious, and easy to prepare.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you enjoy browsing through my recipes listed below.
