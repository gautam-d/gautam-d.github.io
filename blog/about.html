    <h3>~ About Me ~</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a Gen Xer of Indian ethnicity, born and raised in the Middle East, pursued further education in the USA, and have been living here since. My educational and professional background 
       is in mechanical engineering, but my other interests include drawing, cooking, listening to music, and swimming. I hope to use my blog to showcase some of these interests</p>
