    <h3>~ About Me ~</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a Gen Xer of Indian ethnicity, born and raised in the Middle East, and now living in the USA. My educational background is in mechanical engineering, but my other interests include 
       drawing, cooking food, listening to music and swimming. I hope to use my blog to showcase some of these interests</p>
